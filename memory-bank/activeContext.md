# Active Context

## Current Status
The project is initialized and appears to be feature-complete for a "v1.0" release or late beta. The core functionality (chat, context management, gamification, backend sync) is implemented.

## Recent Focus
- **Memory Bank Initialization:** Establishing the project context documentation.
- **Documentation:** The presence of `DOCUMENTATION/` and `INCIDENT-REPORTS/` suggests a focus on stability and process maturity.

## Active Tasks
- [ ] **Verify Environment:** Ensure local development environment is correctly configured.
- [ ] **Codebase Exploration:** Deepen understanding of specific implementations (e.g., how the "diff" view is rendered, how E2EE key management works).

## Decision Log
- **Initialization:** Created Memory Bank files (`projectbrief`, `productContext`, `systemPatterns`, `techContext`, `progress`, `activeContext`) to structure development context.
