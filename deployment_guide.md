# Meaningful Conversations - Deployment Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step process for deploying the backend server to Google Cloud Run. It covers the entire workflow, from building the container image to deploying to a staging environment and promoting to production.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The application is deployed using two separate, parallel environments:

1.  **Staging Environment:**
    *   **Purpose:** A testing ground for new features and bug fixes, connected to a separate staging database (`meaningful-convers-db-staging`).
    *   **Schema Management:** This environment is configured with `ENVIRONMENT_TYPE=staging`. When the server starts, it automatically runs `npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss`. This flag allows for rapid iteration during development by applying schema changes even if they would cause data loss (e.g., dropping a column). This behavior is **disabled in production** for safety.

2.  **Production Environment:**
    *   **Purpose:** The live environment for real users. This environment is connected to the production database (`meaningful-convers-db-prod`).
    *   **Safety:** It is configured with `ENVIRONMENT_TYPE=production`. This acts as a critical safety rail, preventing automatic data-loss operations and ensuring the stability of your user data.

The core principle is: **Never deploy untested code to production.** You will always deploy to staging first, verify everything, and only then promote the exact same, verified container image to production.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed and configured:

1.  **Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`):** [Installation Guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
2.  **Podman or Docker:** You must have a container runtime installed to build the application image.
3.  **Authentication:** You must be authenticated with Google Cloud for both the `gcloud` CLI and for Application Default Credentials (ADC), which tools like the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy use.

    Run these commands in your terminal to log in:
    ```bash
    # Log in for the gcloud CLI
    gcloud auth login

    # Set up credentials for other applications like the proxy
    gcloud auth application-default login

    # Set your default project
    gcloud config set project gen-lang-client-0944710545
    ```

## üöÄ Deployment Workflow

### Step 1: Build & Push the Container Image

Every time you make code changes to the backend, you must build a new versioned container image.

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd meaningful-conversations-backend
    ```

2.  **Build the container image:**
    *   Use the `--no-cache` flag to ensure all your latest changes (especially to `schema.prisma` or `package.json`) are included.
    *   Use `--platform linux/amd64` to ensure the image is built for the architecture used by Cloud Run.
    *   Tag the image with a specific version number (e.g., `1.1.0`, `1.2.0`). **Avoid using `:latest`** as it makes tracking and rollbacks difficult.

    ```bash
    # Replace the version tag (e.g., 1.1.0) with your new version
    podman build --no-cache --platform linux/amd64 -t europe-west6-docker.pkg.dev/gen-lang-client-0944710545/backend-images/meaningful-conversations:1.1.0 .
    ```

3.  **Push the image to Artifact Registry:**
    ```bash
    # Use the same image tag you used in the build step
    podman push europe-west6-docker.pkg.dev/gen-lang-client-0944710545/backend-images/meaningful-conversations:1.1.0
    ```

### Step 2: Deploy to the Staging Environment

Use the `gcloud run deploy` command to deploy your new image to the staging service. This command also sets all the necessary environment variables.

1.  **Prepare your credentials:** Gather all the secrets and configuration values for your **staging** environment.

2.  **Run the deploy command:**
    *   Replace the `[PLACEHOLDER]` values with your actual staging credentials.
    *   **Crucially**, ensure that `ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` is set to `staging`.
    *   The command is wrapped in single quotes (`'`) to prevent your shell from misinterpreting special characters in your passwords or keys.

    ```bash
    # DEPLOY TO STAGING
    gcloud run deploy meaningful-conversations-backend-staging \
        --image europe-west6-docker.pkg.dev/gen-lang-client-0944710545/backend-images/meaningful-conversations:1.1.0 \
        --platform managed \
        --region europe-west6 \
        --allow-unauthenticated \
        --add-cloudsql-instances 'gen-lang-client-0944710545:europe-west6:meaningful-convers-db-staging' \
        --set-env-vars='API_KEY=[YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY],JWT_SECRET=[YOUR_JWT_SECRET],FRONTEND_URL=[YOUR_STAGING_FRONTEND_URL],MAILJET_API_KEY=[YOUR_MAILJET_KEY],MAILJET_SECRET_KEY=[YOUR_MAILJET_SECRET],MAILJET_SENDER_EMAIL=[YOUR_SENDER_EMAIL],DB_USER=[YOUR_STAGING_DB_USER],DB_PASSWORD=[YOUR_STAGING_DB_PASSWORD],DB_NAME=meaningful-convers-db-staging,INSTANCE_UNIX_SOCKET=/cloudsql/gen-lang-client-0944710545:europe-west6:meaningful-convers-db-staging,ENVIRONMENT_TYPE=staging,INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL=[YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL],INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=[YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD]'
    ```

### Step 3: Test the Staging Environment

1.  **Health Check:** Open the staging backend's URL in your browser and go to the `/api/health` path to confirm it's running. The server startup logs in Google Cloud Logging should also indicate that the schema was pushed and the admin user was checked/created.
2.  **Frontend Integration:** Run your frontend locally (`npx serve .` from the root directory) and test it against the newly deployed staging backend by using the `?backend=staging` URL parameter.
    *   Example: `http://localhost:3000/?backend=staging`
3.  **Full Regression Test:** Thoroughly test all application features: registration, login (especially as the admin user), chat sessions, context updates, etc.

## üèÜ The Promotion Workflow: Staging to Production

Once you have thoroughly tested your new version (`1.1.0` in this example) in the staging environment and are confident it is stable and correct, you can promote it to production.

### Step 1: Create Production Resources

If you haven't already, create the parallel resources for your production environment:
*   A new Cloud SQL instance (e.g., `meaningful-convers-db-prod`).
*   A new database inside that instance (e.g., `meaningful_convos_db_prod`).
*   A new Cloud Run service (e.g., `meaningful-conversations-backend-prod`).

### Step 2: Deploy the Verified Image to Production

The most important rule of promotion is to deploy the **exact same container image** that you just tested in staging. **Do not rebuild the container.**

1.  **Prepare your Production Credentials:** Gather all the secrets and configuration values for your **production** environment. Use Google Secret Manager for these.

2.  **Run the Production Deploy Command:**
    *   Notice that the `--image` flag points to the **same version tag (`1.1.0`)**.
    *   All environment variables now point to your **production** resources (`DB_NAME`, `INSTANCE_UNIX_SOCKET`, etc.).
    *   **CRITICALLY**, `ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` is set to `production`.

    ```bash
    # DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION
    gcloud run deploy meaningful-conversations-backend-prod \
        --image europe-west6-docker.pkg.dev/gen-lang-client-0944710545/backend-images/meaningful-conversations:1.1.0 \
        --platform managed \
        --region europe-west6 \
        --allow-unauthenticated \
        --add-cloudsql-instances 'gen-lang-client-0944710545:europe-west6:meaningful-convers-db-prod' \
        --set-env-vars='API_KEY=[YOUR_PROD_GEMINI_KEY],...,DB_USER=[YOUR_PROD_DB_USER],DB_PASSWORD=[YOUR_PROD_DB_PASSWORD],DB_NAME=meaningful-convers-db-prod,INSTANCE_UNIX_SOCKET=/cloudsql/...,ENVIRONMENT_TYPE=production,INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL=[YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL],INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=[YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD]'
    ```

### Step 3: Final Verification

1.  **Health Check:** Verify the production backend's `/api/health` endpoint.
2.  **Deploy Frontend:** Deploy your frontend application to your live domain.
3.  **Smoke Test:** Perform a final, quick test of the core features (login, a short chat session) on your live production URL.

Your application is now live!
