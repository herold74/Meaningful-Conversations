  "scenario_dpc_ocean_bot3": "Those are measurable areas. Have you considered how you could systematically build this experience - even without immediately taking on the full position?",

  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_user6": "Honestly... a bit ashamed. I was so focused on my deadlines that I didn't notice he might need help.",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_bot6": "That's a valuable realization. What would you like to do differently now?",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_user7": "Maybe talk to him first. Not about the delays, but ask how he's doing. As a colleague, not as an accuser.",

  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user2": "It sounds like creative hippie stuff. Sticking colorful Post-Its and pretending. I'm an engineer, I solve problems with data and logic.",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot2": "You have a proven method that works for you. Why do you think your boss is suggesting this anyway?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user3": "He says I jump to solutions too quickly. But isn't that efficiency? Why waste time 'collecting ideas'?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot3": "Efficiency is valuable. Were there situations where your quick approach didn't work optimally?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user4": "Hmm... in the last project, the client didn't accept the solution. He said we didn't understand his actual problem.",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot4": "Interesting. Looking back, what could you have done differently?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user5": "Maybe... ask more questions? Listen more to what he really needs instead of jumping right in. But that's hard for me - I see a problem and want to solve it.",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot5": "You're recognizing a pattern. How about seeing the course as an experiment - not as a replacement for your strengths, but as a complement?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user6": "An experiment... okay, I hadn't looked at it that way. I could try it and see if there's anything useful.",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot6": "You're opening up to a new perspective while keeping your core strengths. What would be a concrete first step?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user7": "I'll sign up for the course and go in with the mindset: What can I learn here that complements my technical skills?",

  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot2": "I hear that reliability and clear structures are very important to you. [Blindspot-Trigger] May I ask a direct question? Could it be that change in general causes you stress - even when it might be beneficial?",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user3": "No, I'm not against change. I'm against pointless change. Agile is just a buzzword.",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot3": "I understand. When was the last time you experienced a major change positively?",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user4": "...I have to think about that. Moving to the new apartment three years ago was good.",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot4": "What made that move a positive change?",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user5": "It was well planned. We had months of lead time, clear checklists, everything organized.",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot5": "So it's not changes themselves that stress you - but unprepared, chaotic changes?",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user6": "Hmm... yes, actually. When I have time to prepare and make a plan, I feel better about it.",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot6": "That's an important self-insight. You need structure to embrace change. How could you create this structure with agile methods?",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user7": "Maybe learn the basics first, before we start. Do a workshop to understand how it works.",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot7": "Exactly - structure in preparation gives you security for flexibility afterward. You stay true to yourself while opening up to something new.",
