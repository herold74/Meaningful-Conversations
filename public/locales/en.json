  "scenario_dpc_riemann_user3": "Usually I first create a detailed task list and a schedule. But here I don't even know what's involved.",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_bot3": "A structured approach has helped you before. What would be the smallest first step to gain more clarity - even if the big picture is still unclear?",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_user4": "Maybe first gather all the information I have. And then ask my boss what the key deliverables should be.",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_bot4": "That's a very concrete and systematic approach. Collect, sort, prioritize - that creates order in chaos. What do you need to prepare for this conversation with your boss?",

  "scenario_dpc_riemann_bot5": "Excellent - you've already identified the key structuring questions. When would be a good time to have this conversation?",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_user6": "Tomorrow morning, before the day gets hectic. Then I have the rest of the day to process the information and create my plan.",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_bot6": "A clear timeframe provides security. You now have a concrete next step: clarification meeting tomorrow morning, then structured planning. That's a very thoughtful, methodical approach that suits your working style. How do you feel about this approach?",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_user7": "Much better already. When I have a plan, I can work in a focused manner. But what if my boss constantly changes the requirements?",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_bot7": "That's a valid concern. Changes during a project can disrupt a carefully created plan. Let's look at this more closely: Have you experienced frequent requirement changes in the past? And how did you deal with it?",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_user8": "Yes, unfortunately quite often. The last project was a nightmare - constant new requests, no clear prioritization. I tried to do everything in parallel and was completely burned out in the end.",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_bot8": "That sounds like a very stressful experience. You tried to bring order to a system that was constantly disrupted from the outside. That costs an enormous amount of energy. What could you do differently this time to better protect yourself?",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_user9": "Maybe set boundaries from the beginning. Agree on a process for how changes must be submitted. And regular check-ins to minimize surprises.",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_bot9": "Excellent. You're building yourself a stable framework that allows flexibility without descending into chaos. A defined change-request process gives you control over changes instead of being at their mercy. That's a mature approach. How specifically would you address this with your boss?",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_user10": "I could make a proposal: 'Let's agree that new requirements are collected and prioritized in a weekly meeting.' That gives me predictability.",
  "scenario_dpc_riemann_bot10": "That's a very professional approach. You're presenting a solution, not a problem. You're taking responsibility for the project structure instead of waiting for others to provide it. That shows leadership quality. With the clarification meeting tomorrow and this structured change management, you now have a solid plan. How confident do you feel on a scale of 1-10?",

  "scenario_dpc_ocean_bot2": "You hold yourself to high standards. What specific skills do you feel you're missing?",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_user3": "Mainly leadership experience. I've never led a team. And I've never had budget responsibility either.",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_bot3": "Those are measurable areas. Have you considered how you could systematically build this experience - even without immediately taking on the full position?",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_user4": "Maybe I could ask to lead a small project. Or ask if I can at least observe budget planning sessions.",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_bot4": "A gradual build-up - that's a careful approach. What concrete opportunities do you see in your current environment for such learning experiences?",

  "scenario_dpc_ocean_user6": "I'll write down what I want to learn from each opportunity, then talk to my boss. Maybe next week in our 1:1.",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_bot6": "A thoughtful plan: define goals, then address them specifically. You're approaching the promotion methodically rather than jumping in unprepared. That shows real professionalism and self-awareness. Are there other aspects of the new role that concern you?",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_user7": "Yes, actually. I'm worried about whether I can present well enough. In the new role, I'd have to speak regularly in front of management.",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_bot7": "Presenting is challenging for many people. You've already shown that you're willing to work systematically on your development areas. What exactly worries you about presenting? Is it the content, the performance, or something else?",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_user8": "More the performance. I can structure and prepare the content well. But standing in front of many people and speaking freely - that makes me nervous and my voice sometimes shakes.",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_bot8": "That's an important distinction. Your strength in preparation and structuring is already a solid foundation. The nervousness during the actual presentation is something that can be trained. Many excellent speakers started with similar challenges. Have you already tried strategies to deal with the nervousness?",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_user9": "I try to memorize everything. But then I stumble even more when I forget a sentence. Maybe that's the wrong approach.",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_bot9": "That's a wise self-realization. Memorizing can be counterproductive because it leaves little room for natural adaptation. An alternative approach would be to only know the key points and then formulate freely. That requires less perfection and often seems more authentic. How does that sound to you?",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_user10": "Scary, honestly. But also somehow liberating. Less control, but perhaps more naturalness. I could practice this on a small scale - maybe first at team meetings.",
  "scenario_dpc_ocean_bot10": "That's a wonderful next step. You're combining your systematic approach with a learning process: first practice in a safe environment, then gradually increase. Team meetings are perfect for that - low stakes, regular repetition. You're methodically building competence and self-confidence. How does this overall plan for your career development feel now?",

  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_bot3": "Objectivity gives you security. Have you ever talked to him directly - not about the facts, but about what's going on with him?",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_user4": "No, not really. I... I don't know if it would help. But now that you ask - he's been looking pretty worn out lately.",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_bot4": "You noticed that. What do you think might be going on with him?",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_user5": "No idea... His wife moved out a few months ago, he mentioned once. Maybe that's related. I never asked.",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_bot5": "It sounds like you're seeing a different side of the situation now. How does that feel?",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_user6": "Honestly... a bit ashamed. I was so focused on my deadlines that I didn't notice he might need help.",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_bot6": "That's a valuable realization. What would you like to do differently now?",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_user7": "Maybe talk to him first. Not about the delays, but ask how he's doing. As a colleague, not as an accuser.",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_bot7": "You're moving from a purely factual to a human perspective. That shows true empathy and compassion. This approach could not only improve your collaboration but also enable a deeper connection with your colleague. What would you specifically say to him?",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_user8": "I would ask him if we could have lunch together. Just casually, without an agenda. And then carefully ask how he's really doing. Show that I care.",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_bot8": "That's a very thoughtful approach. You're creating a safe space without the pressure of daily work. It's remarkable how your perspective has shifted - from documenting failures to genuine human concern. How does this change feel to you?",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_user9": "Honestly? It feels right. I realized I was hiding behind the facts because it was easier than allowing real closeness. But that's not getting me anywhere - neither with him nor generally with the team.",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_bot9": "That's a deep self-realization. You've recognized that factual distance can sometimes be a protective mechanism that shields us from the vulnerability of genuine connections. At the same time, you now see that this closeness and warmth is important for successful collaboration. What would you like to change long-term?",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_user10": "I want to be more open. Build more trust. Not always just see the work, but also the people behind it. That makes me more vulnerable, but also more authentic.",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_bot10": "That's a courageous decision. You're consciously choosing more closeness and connection, even though you know it carries risks. This willingness to open up and nurture relationships is a strength, not a weakness. How specifically do you want to implement this in your daily life?",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_user11": "I'm committing to having at least one personal conversation every day. Not about tasks, but about how people are doing. And I'll delete my spreadsheet with the delays - I don't need it anymore.",
  "scenario_dpfl_riemann_bot11": "That's symbolically very significant. You're letting go of the distant documentation and opening yourself to genuine human connection. This development - from analytical distance to warm closeness - shows personal growth. You've taken an important step today. How do you feel about this new direction?",

  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot1": "What exactly is your concern about it?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user2": "It sounds like creative hippie stuff. Sticking colorful Post-Its and pretending. I'm an engineer, I solve problems with data and logic.",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot2": "You have a proven method that works for you. Why do you think your boss is suggesting this anyway?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user3": "He says I jump to solutions too quickly. But isn't that efficiency? Why waste time 'collecting ideas'?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot3": "Efficiency is valuable. Were there situations where your quick approach didn't work optimally?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user4": "Hmm... in the last project, the client didn't accept the solution. He said we didn't understand his actual problem.",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot4": "Interesting. Looking back, what could you have done differently?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user5": "Maybe... ask more questions? Listen more to what he really needs instead of jumping right in. But that's hard for me - I see a problem and want to solve it.",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot5": "You're recognizing a pattern. How about seeing the course as an experiment - not as a replacement for your strengths, but as a complement?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user6": "An experiment... okay, I hadn't looked at it that way. I could try it and see if there's anything useful.",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot6": "You're opening up to a new perspective while keeping your core strengths. What would be a concrete first step?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user7": "I'll sign up for the course and go in with the mindset: What can I learn here that complements my technical skills?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot7": "A learning-oriented attitude - you're combining curiosity with your analytical approach. That's a powerful combination that could open new possibilities for you. How does it feel to embrace something new and unknown?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user8": "Unusual, but also somehow exciting. I notice I'm curious about what happens in this course. Maybe there really are methods I don't know yet that could help me.",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot8": "This curiosity is a wonderful driver for personal growth. You're opening yourself to new experiences and possibilities instead of rejecting them outright. That's a remarkable development. What specifically do you hope to get from the course?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user9": "Maybe new perspectives on problem-solving. Creative approaches that I can then combine with my analytical skills. And perhaps also new contacts with people who think differently than I do.",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot9": "You recognize the value of diversity in thinking approaches. The combination of creative and analytical methods can lead to innovative solutions. And the openness to people with different perspectives enriches not only professionally but also personally. What led you to reconsider your initial skepticism?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user10": "This conversation with you, honestly. I realized that my 'that's hippie stuff' reflex was more fear of the unknown than real criticism. I've learned that openness can also be a strength.",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot10": "That's a valuable self-realization. You've recognized that hasty judgments are sometimes self-protection from the unknown. This willingness to question your own assumptions and be open to new things is an important development. How would you like to cultivate this openness in the future?",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_user11": "I'll try to think 'Interesting, tell me more' with new ideas instead of immediately 'that won't work'. Develop a kind of experimental attitude - like a scientist testing a hypothesis.",
  "scenario_dpfl_ocean_bot11": "That's a wonderful approach - you're connecting your scientific mindset with openness to the untried. 'Interesting, tell me more' is a powerful phrase that opens doors instead of closing them. You've made an important journey from skepticism to curiosity today. That shows real personal growth and willingness to develop.",

  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user2": "No fixed plans, constant changes, unclear long-term responsibilities. How can you work reliably like that?",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot2": "I hear that reliability and clear structures are very important to you. [Blindspot-Trigger] May I ask a direct question? Could it be that change in general causes you stress - even when it might be beneficial?",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user3": "No, I'm not against change. I'm against pointless change. Agile is just a buzzword.",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot3": "I understand. When was the last time you experienced a major change positively?",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user4": "...I have to think about that. Moving to the new apartment three years ago was good.",

  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user6": "Hmm... yes, actually. When I have time to prepare and make a plan, I feel better about it.",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot6": "That's an important self-insight. You need structure to embrace change. How could you create this structure with agile methods?",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user7": "Maybe learn the basics first, before we start. Do a workshop to understand how it works.",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot7": "Exactly - structure in preparation gives you security for flexibility afterward. You stay true to yourself while opening up to something new. That's an elegant solution that leverages your strengths. Who could lead this workshop?",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user8": "There's a colleague in IT who already has experience with agile methods. She gave a presentation once that was actually quite reasonably structured.",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot8": "Interesting - you remember a positive experience with someone who already practices agile methods. That suggests you might not be rejecting the method itself, but how it's sometimes implemented. What exactly did you like about her presentation?",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user9": "She had clear examples, explained the process step by step, and most importantly - she admitted it doesn't fit everything. That was honest and not dogmatic.",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot9": "You appreciate honesty and differentiated thinking. That shows you're open to new approaches when they're presented with integrity. Could she perhaps be the right person to introduce your team to the topic - in a way that fits your company culture?",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_user10": "Yes, I could ask her. And maybe have a conversation with her beforehand to discuss our specific concerns. Then she can tailor the workshop accordingly.",
  "scenario_dpc_blindspot_bot10": "That's a very thoughtful approach. You're actively taking responsibility for the change process instead of just enduring it.
