# Meaningful Conversations

An application that provides access to several coaching bot characters with different perspectives and coaching styles. Users can create a "life context" file to personalize conversations and update it with new insights after each session.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Multiple AI Coaches**: Engage with a variety of AI coaches, each with a unique style (e.g., Stoic, CBT, Strategic Thinking).
*   **Persistent Memory**: Utilize a "Life Context" file (`.md`) that acts as the AI's long-term memory, enabling continuous and personalized conversations over time.
*   **Automated Context Updates**: At the end of each session, the AI analyzes the conversation and proposes updates to your Life Context file, helping you track insights and progress.
*   **Voice & Text Chat**: Interact with your coach via text or a hands-free voice conversation mode.
*   **End-to-End Encryption**: For registered users, your Life Context file is end-to-end encrypted. Only you can decrypt it on your device with your password.
*   **Gamification**: Stay motivated with a system of XP, levels, streaks, and achievements that reward regular self-reflection.
*   **Guest Mode**: Try the app without an account. Your data is processed entirely in your browser and you manage your file manually.
*   **Multi-language Support**: Available in English and German.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**:
    *   React 19 (using modern ESM modules and import maps)
    *   TypeScript
    *   Tailwind CSS
    *   Web Speech API for voice features
    *   Web Crypto API for End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)
*   **Backend**:
    *   Node.js & Express.js
    *   Prisma ORM with MySQL
    *   JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
    *   Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`) for proxied chat and analysis

## üìÇ Project Structure

This is a monorepo-style project containing both the frontend and the backend server.

*   `/` (root): Contains the frontend React application source code.
*   `/meaningful-conversations-backend`: Contains the backend Node.js server application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project has two main parts: a **frontend** (the user interface in your browser) and a **backend** (the server that powers it). You need to run both in separate terminals.

### 1. Backend Setup

The backend server is required for the frontend to function. Please follow the detailed setup instructions in the backend's README file to install its dependencies, configure your `.env` file, and set up the database.

**‚û°Ô∏è [`meaningful-conversations-backend/README.md`](./meaningful-conversations-backend/README.md)**

### 2. Frontend Setup

The frontend is a modern React application that runs directly in the browser without a build step.

1.  **Serve the frontend files**:
    *   **Important:** Make sure you are in the project's **root directory** (`Meaningful-Conversations-Project`), *not* the `meaningful-conversations-backend` subfolder.
    *   Use a simple static file server. The `serve` package is a good option.
    ```bash
    # If you don't have 'serve' installed globally:
    npx serve .

    # If you have it installed globally:
    serve .
    ```

2.  **Open the application**:
    *   Your terminal will show a local URL, typically `http://localhost:3000`. Open this in your browser. This is the **frontend** application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Workflow: Local vs. Cloud

It's important to understand the two ways you will run the backend.

### Local Development (Your Machine)

This is what you do when writing and testing code. You will need **two separate terminals**.

#### **Terminal 1 (Backend):**

1.  Navigate into the backend folder and start the server. This will run on port **3001**.
    ```bash
    cd meaningful-conversations-backend
    npm run dev
    ```

#### **Terminal 2 (Frontend):**

1.  Navigate to the **project root folder** and start the frontend server. This will run on port **3000**.
    ```bash
    # If you are in the backend folder from the previous step, go back up:
    cd ..

    # Now serve the files from the root folder:
    npx serve .
    ```

#### **Testing in Your Browser:**

Access your frontend at `http://localhost:3000` but add the `?backend=local` parameter to the URL:
*   **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/?backend=local`
*   This tells your frontend (running on `localhost:3000`) to send API requests to the backend server running on your local machine (at `localhost:3001`).

### Cloud Deployment (Google Cloud Run)

This is what you do when you are ready to publish your changes to a staging or production environment on the internet.

1.  **Package and Deploy**: Follow the instructions in the **[`deployment_guide.md`](./deployment_guide.md)** to build your backend into a container and deploy it to a service like Google Cloud Run.
2.  **Test the Deployed Backend**: To test your frontend against a deployed "staging" backend, use the `?backend=staging` parameter:
    *   **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/?backend=staging`

## üß† Key Concepts

*   **Life Context File**: A markdown (`.md`) file that serves as your personal journal and the AI's memory. It's structured with headings to store your goals, challenges, and progress. A well-structured file leads to better coaching insights.

*   **Session Flow**:
    1.  **Start**: Create a new Life Context file via a guided questionnaire or upload an existing one.
    2.  **Coach**: Select a coach whose style matches your current needs.
    3.  **Converse**: Chat with your coach via text or voice.
    4.  **Review**: End the session to receive an AI-generated summary, actionable next steps, and proposed updates to your Life Context file.
    5.  **Update**: Review the proposed changes, make manual edits if needed, and save (for registered users) or download your updated file for the next session.

*   **Privacy & E2EE**: Privacy is a core design principle. In guest mode, nothing is stored on the server. For registered users, the Life Context is encrypted *before* it leaves your browser and can only be decrypted by you. **This means if you forget your password, your data is permanently irrecoverable.**
