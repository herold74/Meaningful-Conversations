  "faq_title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq_q1_q": "Is my data private?",
  "faq_q1_a": "Yes. If you use Guest Mode, your context file is never stored on our servers. It is processed in-memory during your session and it's your responsibility to download the updated file. If you create an account, your data is stored securely in our database and is not used for any other purpose.",
  "faq_q2_q": "Can this replace a human coach or therapist?",
  "faq_q2_a": "No. This tool is for self-reflection and personal development only. It is not a substitute for professional therapy, medical advice, or a human coach. Please consult a qualified professional for any mental health concerns.",
  "faq_q3_q": "Why do I need a 'Life Context' file?",
  "faq_q3_a": "The context file provides the AI with long-term memory. Standard chatbots forget everything once the conversation is over. This file allows your coach to remember your goals, challenges, and past conversations, leading to a much more meaningful and effective experience.",
  "faq_q4_q": "What happens when I 'End Session'?",
  "faq_q4_a": "Ending the session triggers an AI-powered analysis of your conversation. The AI identifies key insights and proposes updates to your context file, helping you integrate what you've learned. It's a crucial step for growth.",
  "faq_q5_q": "What are the different user levels for?",
  "faq_q5_a": "The user levels determine which coaches you can access:",
  "faq_q5_a_li1": "Guests: Access to a selection of our core coaches.",

  "faq_q5_a_footer": "This allows us to offer a free and accessible entry point while providing more value to our registered users.",
  "faq_q6_q": "Why do I have to download the context file as a guest?",
  "faq_q6_a": "This is a core part of our privacy-first design for guests. By not storing your file, we ensure that you and only you have control over your data. Downloading the file at the end of a session is how you 'save your game' for the next time you play.",
