  "faq_q1_q": "Is my data private?",
  "faq_q1_a": "Yes. If you use Guest Mode, all data is processed in your browser and is never stored on a server. If you register an account, your Life Context is end-to-end encrypted. You are always in control.",
  "faq_q2_q": "Why do I need a 'Life Context' file?",
  "faq_q2_a": "Large Language Models are stateless, meaning they don't remember past conversations. The Life Context file provides this memory, allowing for deep, continuous coaching sessions over time.",
  "faq_q3_q": "Can I use the app without a file?",
  "faq_q3_a": "Yes, you can start a session with an empty context by using the 'Create a New Life Context File' option and leaving the questionnaire blank. The conversation will be less personalized, but still functional.",
  "faq_q4_q": "What happens when I 'End Session'?",
  "faq_q4_a": "Your conversation is sent to a powerful AI model for analysis. It summarizes new insights and suggests how to update your Life Context file based on the discussion.",
  "faq_q5_q": "Why is Voice Mode not working or the voice quality poor?",
  "faq_q5_a": "Voice Mode relies on your browser's built-in Web Speech API. Support and quality can vary significantly:",
  "faq_q5_a_li1": "**Browser:** Chrome and Edge generally have the best support. Firefox and Safari may have limitations or fewer high-quality voices.",
  "faq_q5_a_li2": "**Operating System:** Your OS provides the voices. Some operating systems offer 'premium' or 'enhanced' voices that you may need to download in your system's settings.",
  "faq_q5_a_footer": "For the best experience, we recommend using a modern Chromium-based browser (like Chrome or Edge) on a desktop operating system.",
  "faq_q6_q": "What is the gamification system for?",
  "faq_q6_a": "The levels, streaks, and achievements are designed as a light-hearted way to encourage regular self-reflection, which is key to personal growth.",
