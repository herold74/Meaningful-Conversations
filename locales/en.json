By interacting with AI coaches that have distinct, well-defined methodologies, users can gain new perspectives on their challenges and aspirations. The 'Life Context' file acts as a persistent memory, allowing for a continuous and evolving coaching journey.",
  "about_howitworks_title": "How It Works",
  "about_howitworks_p1": "The application leverages the power of Google's Gemini API. Each coach is defined by a detailed system prompt that outlines their persona, coaching framework, and rules of engagement. At the end of each session, another AI prompt analyzes the conversation to provide a summary and suggest updates to your context file, creating a cycle of reflection and growth.",
  "faq_title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq_q1_q": "Is my data private?",
  "faq_q1_a": "Yes. If you use 'Guest Mode', your life context file is never stored on our servers. It is sent to the AI for processing during your session but is deleted from memory immediately after. If you create an account, your data is stored securely to allow for a continuous experience, but it is never used for training or viewed by humans.",
  "faq_q2_q": "What is a 'Life Context' file?",
  "faq_q2_a": "It's a simple text file in Markdown format (.md) that acts as the long-term memory for your AI coach. It helps the coach understand your background, goals, and previous conversations, leading to more relevant and effective coaching.",
  "faq_q3_q": "Can the AI give me medical or legal advice?",
  "faq_q3_a": "No. The AI coaches are not licensed professionals. This application is for self-reflection and personal growth only. It is not a substitute for professional therapy, medical advice, or legal counsel. Please consult a qualified professional for such matters.",
  "faq_q4_q": "How does the session analysis work?",
  "faq_q4_a": "At the end of your session, the entire conversation transcript is sent to the AI with a special prompt. This prompt instructs the AI to summarize key insights, identify actionable next steps, and propose specific additions or changes to your life context file based on what was discussed.",
  "faq_q5_q": "Why is Voice Mode not working?",
  "faq_q5_a": "The Voice Mode relies on your web browser's built-in Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis APIs. Functionality can vary significantly between browsers and operating systems.",
  "faq_q5_a_li1": "For the best experience, we recommend using Google Chrome on a desktop computer.",
  "faq_q5_a_li2": "Make sure you have granted the website permission to access your microphone.",
  "faq_q5_a_footer": "If issues persist, it may be a limitation of your current browser.",
  "faq_q6_q": "How can I report a problem or give feedback?",
  "faq_q6_a": "During a chat session, you can hover over any response from the coach and click the small flag icon that appears. This will open a feedback form allowing you to report any issues with that specific response.",
