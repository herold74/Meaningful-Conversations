At the end of each session, the AI suggests updates to this context, creating a living document of your personal journey.",

  "faq_q1_q": "Is my data saved?",
  "faq_q1_a": "No. We prioritize your privacy. All conversations and the 'Life Context' you provide are processed in your browser's memory and are permanently gone when you end the session or close the browser tab. You must download your updated context file at the end of a session to save your progress.",
  "faq_q2_q": "How is my privacy protected with the 'Life Context' file?",
  "faq_q2_a": "The application offers two modes. In Guest Mode, you are in full control; you must upload your Life Context file at the start and download it at the end of each session. Nothing is stored by the app. For Registered Users, your context is saved to your account for convenience, but is never shared. In both modes, we strongly advise against including personally identifiable information (PII) in your file to ensure maximum privacy.",
  "faq_q3_q": "Can the AI diagnose me or provide therapy?",
  "faq_q3_a": "Absolutely not. The AI coaches are not medical professionals and cannot provide diagnoses, therapy, or any form of medical advice. This tool is for self-reflection and personal growth only. Please seek help from a qualified professional for any mental health concerns.",
  "faq_q4_q": "Who are the different coaches?",
  "faq_q4_a": "Each coach is an AI persona powered by the same advanced language model but guided by a unique \"system prompt.\" This prompt defines their personality, coaching style (like Stoicism or CBT), and area of focus, allowing you to choose the approach that best suits your needs for a particular session.",

  "faq_q5_a_footer": "You advance to the next level for every 100 XP you accumulate.",
  "faq_q6_q": "How does the voice feature work?",
  "faq_q6_a": "For coaches with voice enabled (like Rob), we use your browser's built-in Web Speech API for both speech-to-text and text-to-speech. This means your voice data is processed by your browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Safari) and not by our application servers, further protecting your privacy.",
