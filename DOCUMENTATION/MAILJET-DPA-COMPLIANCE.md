## How Sinch/Mailjet DPA Works

Similar to Google Cloud, Sinch's (Mailjet's parent company) DPA:

1. **Automatically applies** to all customers with active Mailjet/Sinch accounts
2. **Is integrated** into the Principal Service Agreement (Terms of Service)
3. **Becomes binding** when you create and use a Mailjet account
4. **Forms part of** the underlying services agreement - no separate signature needed

**Evidence of Coverage**:
- ✅ Active Mailjet account
- ✅ Using Mailjet Email API service
- ✅ Downloaded official DPA document
- ✅ Accepted Mailjet Terms of Service

**From the DPA (Version 8)**:
> "This Data Processing Agreement (this "DPA") forms part of and is subject to the underlying services agreement (the "Principal Agreement") between the Sinch entity ("Sinch") and the customer entity ("Customer") that have entered into such Principal Agreement for Sinch's provision of Services to Customer."

This means: **No separate DPA signing required** - it's automatically part of your service agreement!
