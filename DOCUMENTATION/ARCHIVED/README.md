# Archived Documentation

This folder contains historical documentation that is no longer actively used but preserved for reference and historical context.

## What Goes Here

- **Historical summaries**: Documentation cleanup reports, migration summaries from completed projects
- **Superseded guides**: Older versions of guides that have been replaced with updated versions
- **Project history**: Development timelines and feature evolution narratives

## What Does NOT Go Here

- **Active operational guides**: Deployment, setup, troubleshooting docs (keep in main DOCUMENTATION/)
- **Current feature docs**: Implementation guides for features still in use
- **Reference materials**: Compliance docs, API guides, server configs still relevant

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

These documents provide valuable context for:
- Understanding why certain technical decisions were made
- Troubleshooting issues by reviewing past incident reports
- Onboarding new developers who need project history
- Learning from past migrations and refactors

## File Organization

Files are archived with their original names. If you're looking for something specific:

1. Check `DOCUMENTATION-STRUCTURE.md` first - it has an index of active docs
2. If a topic seems missing, search this ARCHIVED/ folder
3. Archived docs may reference files by old paths - use `git log --follow` to trace renames

## Archived Files

### Documentation Meta (Cleanup History)
- **COMPLETE-CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md** - Documentation cleanup from November 2024
- **DOCUMENTATION-CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md** - Earlier cleanup details

### Development History
- **DEVELOPMENT-HISTORY.md** - Detailed feature development timeline (superseded by FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT-TIMELINE.md for recent work)
