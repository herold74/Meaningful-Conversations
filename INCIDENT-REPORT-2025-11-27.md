## 📋 Timeline

| Time  | Event |
|-------|-------|
| 06:00 | ✅ Automated backup ran successfully (36KB backup created) |
| 07:24 | ⚠️ Server restarted for resource limit implementation |
| 07:24 | ❌ NEW empty database volume created (`manualmode-production_mariadb_production_data`) |
| 07:25 | ❌ Container started with empty database, Prisma migrations created only admin user |
| 15:04 | 👤 Frank Basinski registered (only 2 users in database: admin + Frank) |
| 18:00 | 🔔 Issue reported by user: "Only one new user visible" |
| 18:40 | ✅ Database restored from backup (23.11.2025 17:25) |

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened

The production MariaDB container used a **volume name derived from the working directory** instead of a fixed project name. When the server restarted:

1. **Before restart:**
   - Volume: `meaningful-conversations-production_mariadb_production_data` (created 24.11.)
   - Contains: All 14 production users + full database

2. **After restart (07:24):**
   - Volume: `manualmode-production_mariadb_production_data` (**NEW, empty**)
   - Contains: Only admin user (from fresh Prisma migrations)

### Why It Happened

**`podman-compose`** uses the **working directory name** as the project prefix when no explicit `name:` field is set. The compose file lacked a fixed project name:

```yaml
# BEFORE (vulnerable to directory changes)
version: '3.8'
services:
  mariadb:
    volumes:
      - mariadb_production_data:/var/lib/mysql
volumes:
  mariadb_production_data:
```

**Result:** Volume name = `{directory-name}_mariadb_production_data`
- Directory name changes → NEW volume created
- Server restart with different context → NEW volume created

---

## ✅ Resolution

### Immediate Actions (Completed)

1. ✅ **Emergency backup** of current state (to preserve Frank's data)
2. ✅ **Restored database** from backup (23.11.2025 17:25)
3. ✅ **Re-inserted new user** (Frank Basinski) manually
4. ✅ **Verified all 14 users** present and accessible

### Permanent Fix (Completed)

**Modified both `podman-compose-production.yml` and `podman-compose-staging.yml`:**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

# IMPORTANT: Project name is fixed to prevent volume recreation on restart
name: meaningful-conversations-production  # ← ADDED

services:
  mariadb:
    volumes:
      - mariadb_production_data:/var/lib/mysql
volumes:
  mariadb_production_data:
```

**Result:** Volume name will ALWAYS be:
- Production: `meaningful-conversations-production_mariadb_production_data`
- Staging: `manualmode-staging_mariadb_production_data`

### Data Migration (Completed)

Copied restored data from temporary volume to permanent volume:

```bash
rsync -av --delete \
  /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/manualmode-production_mariadb_production_data/_data/ \
  /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/meaningful-conversations-production_mariadb_production_data/_data/
```

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### Users Affected
- **14 total users** in production
- **1 new registration** during incident (Frank Basinski)
- **0 data loss** after recovery

### Services Affected
- ✅ Frontend: Operational (continued serving cached data)
- ✅ Backend: Operational (but with incomplete user database)
- ❌ User authentication: Affected (only admin + Frank could log in)
- ❌ User data access: Affected (12 users temporarily unable to log in)

### Business Impact
- **Duration:** ~11 hours of degraded service
- **Availability:** 99.5% (11h downtime in ~720h month)
- **Data Loss:** NONE (full recovery)
- **Financial Impact:** None (beta users, no paid subscriptions yet)

## 🛡️ Prevention Measures

### Implemented

1. ✅ **Fixed project names** in compose files
2. ✅ **Volume consistency** enforced across restarts
3. ✅ **Daily automated backups** (already in place, saved us!)

### Recommended

1. **Pre-deployment backup automation:**
   ```bash
   # Add to deployment scripts
   ssh root@<YOUR_SERVER_IP> "bash /usr/local/bin/backup-databases.sh"
   ```

2. **Volume monitoring:**
   ```bash
   # Alert on volume changes
   podman volume ls --format "{{.Name}}" | grep mariadb
   ```

3. **Health checks enhancement:**
   - Add user count check to health endpoint
   - Alert if user count drops below threshold

4. **Deployment checklist:**
   - [ ] Verify volume names before restart
   - [ ] Check user count after restart
   - [ ] Validate last user creation timestamp

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

✅ **Automated backups** saved the day (backup from 06:00 was fresh)  
✅ **Quick detection** (issue reported within 11 hours)  
✅ **Full recovery** (no data permanently lost)  
✅ **Old volume preserved** (could have been used as backup)

### What Could Be Improved

⚠️ **Earlier detection** (11h delay is too long)  
⚠️ **Better monitoring** (should have alerted on volume changes)  
⚠️ **Pre-restart checks** (verify volume mapping before restarts)  
⚠️ **User count monitoring** (alert on significant drops)

## 🔧 Recovery Procedures (For Future Reference)

### If Database Loss Occurs Again

1. **DO NOT PANIC** - Backups exist and are tested
2. **Stop the MariaDB container** immediately
3. **List all volumes:**
   ```bash
   podman volume ls | grep mariadb
   ```
4. **Check volume creation dates:**
   ```bash
   podman volume inspect <volume-name> --format '{{.CreatedAt}}'
   ```
5. **Restore from latest backup:**
   ```bash
   cd /opt/manualmode-production
   cat /var/backups/meaningful-conversations/production-<date>.sql.gz | \
     gunzip | \
     podman exec -i meaningful-conversations-mariadb-production \
     bash -c '/usr/bin/mariadb -u root -p${MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD} meaningful_conversations_production'
   ```
6. **Verify user count:**
   ```bash
   podman exec meaningful-conversations-mariadb-production \
     bash -c 'echo "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM User;" | \
     /usr/bin/mariadb -u root -p${MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD} meaningful_conversations_production'
   ```
